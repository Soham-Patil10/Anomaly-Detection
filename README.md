## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent using various anomaly detection techniques. The project explores data preprocessing, feature scaling, and model evaluation using classification metrics.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the `creditcard.csv` dataset, which contains anonymized features of credit card transactions, with the class label indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or non-fraudulent (0).

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
